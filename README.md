# Adonai-Reigns

A Wordpress plugin to enhance websites that reference bible quotes often.

It scans each content block, looking for patterns that look like bible references, then converts those references into links, making a tooltip appear when the mouse hovers the link.

Clicking the link takes the user to read more at www.biblegateway.com.

Tooltip content is stored in the database, and database queries are cached for fastest performance.

# Share the Gospel with your Visitors!

Simply place the shortcode [the_gospel_booklet] anywhere in your Wordpress website, and a digital booklet will appear that visitors can read and learn the basics of the gospel of Jesus Christ!
